                <p> I am a Responsive Designer & Developer who loves to help people build and grow their business on the backend
                    in a creavative coding way, but I am also a wife to an amazing man and a mom to
                    two beautiful girls. I found coding later in life and it has shown me that it's never to later
                    to learn something new. </p>

                     I was born in El Paso, Tx but moved to the 24hr town of Las Vegas, NV at the age
                     of 2. I would consider myself a native, but the "Born and Raised" would like to
                     think other wise.

                <p>
                    I love anything that has to do with being creative. Art, fashion, music all of those things drive
                    me to express my creativity. And now I have coding another outlet to express my creativity.

                    I also, love yoga, snowboarding, hiking, going to the beach and spending all my free time with my family.
                    They are the driving force in my life. I live for them.
